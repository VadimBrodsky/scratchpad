# Migration Methods


- [[Migrations files|Migrate File]] allow for different methods.
- Some are reversible with the `change` method, while some are not.
- Good practice to use the `up` and `down` methods for complex migrations.
- Method in the `down` action will appear reversed as compared to the `up` action.
