# Controller Redirecting Actions


The controller can redirect instead of rendering a view. 

This will send a request to a different controller and action. To do this rails uses a [[HTTP redirect]] that will change the address of the page, and will initiate a new request to the server.

This is done via the [[redirect_to action]]:

{{redirect_to method}}
