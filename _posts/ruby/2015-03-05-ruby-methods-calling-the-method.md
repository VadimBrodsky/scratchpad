- Object method that are applied to an object use the `.` notation.
- Object methods can be chained.
- To call a stand-alone method just call it's name, like a variable.
- Methods have to be defined before they are called.
- Parentheses for method parameters are optional.
- When hashes are the last argument in a function call, the curly braces are optional.

```ruby
"hello".reverse.capitalize
method_name
```
