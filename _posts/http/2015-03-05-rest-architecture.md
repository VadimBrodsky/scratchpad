- REST is an architectural style for developing distributed, networked systems and software applications.
- In the context of Rails applications REST means that most application components are modeled as resources that can be:
  - Created, read, updated, and deletedâ€”operations that correspond both to the CRUD operations of relational databases
  - Four fundamental HTTP request methods: `POST`, `GET`, `PATCH`, and `DELETE`.
