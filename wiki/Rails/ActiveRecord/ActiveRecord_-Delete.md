# ActiveRecord: Delete


There are two styles of row deletion: [[destroy |ActiveRecord: Delete: Destroy]] and [[delete|ActiveRecord: Delete: Delete]].  The [[destroy |ActiveRecord: Delete: Destroy]] style works on the instance. The [[delete|ActiveRecord: Delete: Delete]] style operates on the class.

The [[delete|ActiveRecord: Delete: Delete]] way bypasses some of Rails features and thus less preferred, use [[destroy |ActiveRecord: Delete: Destroy]] instead.
